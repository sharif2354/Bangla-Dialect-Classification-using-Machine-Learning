# Bangla Dialect Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the automatic classification of Bangla dialects using machine learning techniques.  
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various supervised learning algorithms to identify and classify different dialects of Bangla.  

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, embeddings)
- Supervised ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)
- Visualization of results

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Dataset files
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for training & testing
- `models/` → Saved ML models
- `results/` → Evaluation metrics and plots
- `src/` → Python scripts for preprocessing & classification

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- NLP preprocessing libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Goal
To build a reliable system that can detect and classify Bangla dialects automatically, contributing to NLP research in under-resourced languages.
